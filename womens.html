            <p> Each week involves a new workout, more challenging than the last.If, like many runners out there, you're taking your workouts indoors at the moment, you'll probably be looking for some inspiration. Here, we've got a 28 day home workout plan from GB heptathlete-turned PT, Louise Hazel. “You can do these body-weight moves anywhere and each circuit takes just 20 minutes, so no excuses!”</p>
            <h3 >How does the programme work?</h3>
            <p>Each week involves a new workout, more challenging than the last. If you’re a beginner, do weeks 1 to 4; if you’re in the middle, start at week 2, doing it twice before doing weeks 3 and 4; if you’re a pro, do week 2, 3, 4 then 4 again. Do each move for 30 seconds for a circuit. Do 3 circuits with 2-3 mins rest in-between.

                Aim to do the workout 3-4 times a week around your running plan.</p>
            <h3>WEEK ONE</h3>
            <p>This week is a total-body workout to kick-start your metabolism and get you perfecting lean-muscle-building moves.</p>
